# Components

1. **RPI-Pico**: The Raspberry Pi Pico (and its various variants) is an awesome single board computer which can be programmed in **C** and **MicroPython**. It is a cost-effective alternative to the Arduino or the "big" Raspberry Pi.
1. **HC-SR04**: This is an **ultrasonic sensor** commonly used for **measuring distance** through emitting and detecting ultrasound waves. It's popular in robotics and automation for object detection and range sensing.
1. **HX711**: This is a precision **24-bit analog-to-digital converter** (ADC) designed for **weigh scales** and industrial control applications to interface directly with a bridge sensor. Its primary use is in measuring small changes in electrical resistance from load cells and pressure sensors.
1. **PCA9685**: This is a **16-channel, 12-bit PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) controller**, useful for controlling many PWM outputs like LED lighting and servo motors through just two pins by using **I2C** communication.
1. **PCF8574**: An **8-bit I/O expander** for the two-line bidirectional bus (**I2C**) designed for I/O port expansion in microcontroller applications. Itâ€™s used to increase the number of input/output ports available to a processor or to free up valuable I/O pins.
1. **RC522**: A highly integrated **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) card reader/writer** IC for contactless communication at 13.56 MHz. It's commonly used in security systems, personnel identification, and access control systems. Communication with the RC522 takes place via the **SPI** bus.
1. **WS2812**: This is an **intelligent LED** that integrates the control circuit and **RGB** chip into a package of 5050 components. It's well-known for creating customizable, multi-color LED strips in DIY lighting projects and decorative setups.
